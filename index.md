# Hexapod
<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!-->

Here is my starter project. It is an arduino board with a proto shield on top of it as well as a breadboard on the side. This proto shield allows me to wire several components on top of the arduino. I also used a breadboard to wire a button to the arduino. I have wired two LEDs onto the proto shield, and they are both controlled by the button. I coded them such that the red LED only turns on while the button is pressed, and the green LED is turned on and off whenever the button gets pressed.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was with getting the button to work. I originally wanted to have the button soldered onto the proto shield, but after testing code with this setup, I found out that it was not a stable input source. After doing a little bit of research into wiring buttons, I learned that I needed a constant power source and resistor at the ground source, and so I made the decision to switch to wiring the button on my breadboard instead.

My starter taught me several basics of arduino code, such as how to initalize inputs and outputs, and I also learned how to use a breadboard. It also helped me refine my soldering skills, and I have become much more precise with soldering smaller wires together.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
